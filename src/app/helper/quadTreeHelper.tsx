/*
Quadtree<ZyncData>.visit(callback: (node: QuadtreeLeaf<ZyncData>, x0: number, y0: number, x1: number, y1: number) => boolean | void): Quadtree<ZyncData>
Visits each node in the quadtree in pre-order traversal, 
invoking the specified callback with arguments node, x0, y0, x1, y1 for each node, 
here node is the node being visited, ⟨x0, y0⟩ are the lower bounds of the node, 
and ⟨x1, y1⟩ are the upper bounds, and returns the quadtree.

If the callback returns true for a given node, 
then the children of that node are not visited; otherwise, 
all child nodes are visited. This can be used to quickly visit only parts of the tree.
Note, however, that child quadrants are always visited in sibling 
order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. In cases such as search, 
visiting siblings in a specific order may be faster
